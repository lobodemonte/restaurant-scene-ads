    "Ideally, and more simply, I would do a spatial join as shown above between the NTA and Census Tract shapefiles to determine the NTA each census tract falls into. However, as the print-out above shows, there are multiple duplication of rows post spatial join. Why? The `op` argument in `gpd.sjoin` accepts one of three values: `\"intersects\", \"contains\", \"within\"`. The following [site](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#binary-predicates) by the developers of the `shapely` module describes the different types of spatial joins.   \n",
    "\n",
    "All three are unsuitable as the borders of each NTA and Census Tract do not line up **perfectly**. In other words there are some overlaps here and there which throw off the entire spatial join. Even if the borders line up perfectly, contiguity is an issue. In an `intersect`, it does not matter which side of the line an object is on as long as it touches the line unless a direction argument is available and specified, neither of which are available in this case. That is to say, tract i will be counted as part of both NTAs j and k as long as the border of tract i lines up along the border between NTAs j and k. I imagine common vertices count too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I had to use an equivalency table published by [NYC Planning](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-nynta.page) to map each census tract to the NTA code. This is done using the GEOID column which is common to both tables. The GEOID column in the equivalency table is a new column I created by concatenating State FIPS (36) with County FIPS and Tract ID \n",
    "in Excel before saving and exporting as a CSV. Some table structure cleaning was also performed in Excel prior.   "
